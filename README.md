This python script reads from the selected path and loads a lesion segmentation file and a CT image. As a result, it computes the total volume of the lesion per subject and outputs a bar graph with all results.

<pre><code>dir_path</code></pre>

* To select where results will be saved, the following variable should be edited:

<pre><code>save_path</code></pre>

As an output, the graph result should look like this:
